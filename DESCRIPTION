Description: Read and write JSON Web Keys (JWK, rfc7517), generate and verify JSON
    Web Signatures (JWS, rfc7515) and encode/decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT, rfc7519).
    These standards provide modern signing and encryption formats that are natively
    supported by browsers via the JavaScript WebCryptoAPI, and used by services
    like OAuth 2.0, LetsEncrypt, and Github Apps.
